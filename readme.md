# Cost Per Mile

This project has two aims:

1. Provide a tool for objectively comparing the value of new and used cars for better financial decision making
2. Serve as a platform to experiment with a variety of JavaScript frameworks and CSS strategies

Early commits are intended to be devoid of JavaScript so that a foundation of HTML and CSS can be refined and exist as a common backdrop for a variety of JavaScript implementations.

The idea of **Cost Per Mile** is to boil the expense of a vehicle over its lifetime down into a "cost per mile." By doing so, a used car, whose useful life is shorter can be objectively compared to a new car that is more expensive, but can last longer. This is more extensively described in the app itself.
